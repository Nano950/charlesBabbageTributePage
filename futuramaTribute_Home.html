                      <p>Charles Babbage is a British polymath, skilled in mathematics, philosophy, mechanical engineering, and was an inventor.
                        Babbage played an integral role in creating the Royal Astronomers society, which aimed at promoting the use of math for practical applications, such as navigation.
                        While Babbage invented the cow catcher for locomotives, his most acclaimed creations were the difference engine and the blueprints for a more complex machine: the Analytical engine.
                        The difference engine was the world's first digital computer, which was able to break complex math calculations into simpler subtraction and addition problems by representing numbers 0-9 as teeth on gears.
                        This device was able to perform math calculations more accurately and efficiently than human computers at the time. While Babbage never lived to see the completion of the analytical engine, which according to babbage’s schematics, would be able to perform all types of math calculations, making it the first multi-purpose computer.

                          <h2 >Early Life</h2>
                          <p>While it is disputed where Charles Babbage grew up, it is commonly accepted that he was born in 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Row. 
                            Babbage had three siblings and was the son of Benjamin Babbage, and Plumleigh Teape. Benjamin was a banker who helped create Preads & Co. 
                            At eight years old, Babbage was moved to Alphington, where he attended an academy while receiving treatment for a severe illness at the time. Later in his early years, he attended Holmwood Academy, in Enfield. While he was studying here, his love for math was fostered as he read books from their library.
                          </p>
                        </div>

                        <div id='universityLife' class="col-md-9">
                          <h2 >At the University of Cambridge</h2>
                          <p>Before attending university, Babbage studied under two tutors, The first tutor that he studied under was a minister near Cambridge. 
                            However, he did not learn enough to get accepted into Cambridge. The second tutor that he studied with was in Oxford, where he learned enough classical
                             mathematics to get into Cambridge university, where he attended Trinity College. As he began to study at the school he became disappointed in the way math 
                             was being taught, as he had already been taught classical math in some capacity. Babbage, along with several of his friends, created the analytical society,
                              which aimed at promoting the use of a more efficient symbol notation rather than Newtonian symbols. Later in his college life, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, 
                              Cambridge. At this new school, he was the top mathematician. However, due to the fact that he defended a thesis that was considered blasphemy by the academics 
                              there, he did not receive honors, and graduated without an exam.</p>

                          <h2 >Later Life</h2>
                          <p>Babbage would later go on to be a key part in the formation of the Royal Astronomical Society, which aimed at creating more efficient
                             methods such as using computation in practical applications such as navigation. Babbage’s work in computation was key in the methods that they used, and Babbage would later go on to receive a gold medal in 1824 for inventing a machine that was able to calculate mathematical and astronomical tables, which were full of errors due to the limitation of human abilities.
                            Babbage would go on to live for 40 years, eventually dying due to kidney problems, secondary to cystitis, a bladder infection. Babbage also promoted the idea 
                            of “life peers”; titles that could not be passed down to family, contrary to hereditary peerages. Babbages also declined both a knighthood, and a baronetcy in 
                            his later years.

                          <h2 >Impact on Society</h2>
                          <p>Babbage’s invention of the difference engine was a crucial stepping stone on the way to modern computers today. Without the creation of the first digital 
                            computer, we would not have much of the technology that we have today. While Babbage also invented the cow catcher, which improved safety on trains, it is 
                            without a doubt that his most impactful invention was the Difference Engine. While he did create plans for a more advanced machine, the Analytical Engine, he 
                            did note receive the funding needed to complete the project and died in 1871. </p>
